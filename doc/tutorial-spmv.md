# SpMV Example

In this tutorial, we will look at how a simple iterative calculator for Sparse Matrix Vector operations. The programming Language C is used. SpMV is a popular compute kernel for different kind of simulation (such a Finite Element Problem) and image reconstruction algorithms (such as MLEM).

## Compressed Sparse Row
Compressed Sparse Row is a popular basic storage format for Sparse Matrix. The basic idea is to store only the
